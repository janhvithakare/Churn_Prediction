# Churn_Prediction
# 🎬 Customer Churn Prediction for Netflix Users

This project predicts whether a Netflix customer is likely to **churn (cancel their subscription)** using various machine learning algorithms.  
The model is integrated with a **Streamlit web app** that allows interactive predictions based on user inputs.

## 🚀 Features
- Predict customer churn in real time  
- Simple and clean Streamlit interface  
- Machine Learning model trained using **Random Forest**  
- Automatic data scaling and encoding for accurate predictions

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data preprocessing  
- **Scikit-learn** for model building  
- **Joblib** for model serialization  
- **Streamlit** for web deployment
